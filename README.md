# Strichliste
tally

A Strichliste is a simple tally system used to count occurrences of events or items. Itâ€™s commonly used in Germany for tracking frequencies in various contexts, such as surveys, statistics, or everyday counting tasks.

How It Works:
Each occurrence is marked with a vertical stroke.

Every fifth stroke is drawn diagonally across the previous four, forming a group of five.

This grouping makes it easier to quickly sum up the total.
